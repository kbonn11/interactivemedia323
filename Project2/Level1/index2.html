	<p> When <br> all the golden<br> birds fly home across <br>the blue deep water; On<br> shore I sit rapt in its scattering <br>glitter; departure rustles through the <br>trees. This farewell is vast and separation <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>draws close, but reunion, that also is certain.<br> My head on my arm I fall asleep easily. <br>On my eyes a mother's breath,<br> from her mouth to my<br> heart; sleep, child, <br>and dream <br>now <br>the<br> sun<br> is <br>gone<br>. </p>

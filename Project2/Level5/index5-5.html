			<p>When all the golden birds fly home across the blue deep water; On shore I sit rapt in its scattering glitter; departure rustles through the trees. This farewell is vast and separation draws close, but reunion, that also is certain. My head on my arm I fall asleep easily. On my eyes a mother's breath, from her mouth to my heart: sleep, child, and dream now the sun is gone. </p>
